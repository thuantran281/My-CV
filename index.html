          I'm Thuan Tran. Currently, I'm doing my second year at

          I'm indulged in web development as I have always wanted to know how a
          website operates. My ambition is to be a full-stack developer, and
          contribute to creating some interesting web pages to the users.

          During my spare time, I usually do the coding and read the materials.
          In other words, combining reading and practise coding base as many
          people have said "Practise makes perfect." Also, I spend my time
          playing the guitar, listening to 60s, 70s music, and researching
          various topics.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have basic knowledge of some programming languages such as C,
          Python, a little bit of C++ and Java. Right now, I'm studying OOP and
          using Java as the main programming language. I'm able to handle
          functional programming paradigm. And I hope I could handle OOP
          afterwards.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is just my basic CV website. In the future, I will deploy a more
          advanced, dynamic website with some glamorous effects afterwards
          combining UI/UX.
